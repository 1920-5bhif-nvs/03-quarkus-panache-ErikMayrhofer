= Quote-Management
Erik Mayrhofer <obyoxar@gmail.com>

As a basis for this assignment, I decided not to use my previous projects, because first I didn't
like my data model, and second I currently had the perfect start as a private project.

This project is a quote manager. Such a tool was desired by me and my friends for quite a while
and recently I started working on it.

class Quote {
    + text : String
    + quotedPersons : List<Person>
    + quoter : QuoteUser
}
class Person {
    + firstName : String
    + lastName : String
    + quotes : List<Quote>
}
class User {
    + sub : String
    + person : Person
}

Description: A user (in my private Project will this be connected to keycloak) may
submit a quote. This quote has text and one or more People will be quoted.
